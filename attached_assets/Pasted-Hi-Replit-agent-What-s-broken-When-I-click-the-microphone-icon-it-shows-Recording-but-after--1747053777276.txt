Hi Replit agent,

What’s broken
• When I click the microphone icon it shows “Recording…,” but after I press Stop it sits on “Processing…” forever and no message ever appears.
• The paper-clip / file-upload button does nothing—no picker opens, nothing logs in the console.

What’s probably happening
	1.	voice-interface.js starts recording with MediaRecorder, but the ondataavailable event or the fetch call that sends the blob to the server is never firing (or it hits a JS error).
	2.	file-handler.js likely has an input[type=file] hidden element, yet the click (or change) listener isn’t bound, or the handler tries to POST to an API route that doesn’t exist.
	3.	No backend endpoint is set up to receive either the audio blob or file data, so the front-end fetch promises just hang.
	4.	There may be CORS or content-length limits on Replit’s proxy, blocking larger blobs.
	5.	Browser permissions: mic permission granted, but we never call MediaRecorder.stop() correctly, so dataavailable never fires.

Minimum fixes
• In voice-interface.js: after mediaRecorder.stop(), add a promise chain (or await) that waits for the ondataavailable blob, then POST it to /api/voice.
• In the Flask/Express backend: create POST /api/voice and POST /api/upload routes that accept multipart/form-data or raw blobs, return JSON {url:"/static/uploads/…", text:"transcribed text"}.
• In file-handler.js: make sure we trigger the hidden file-input’s .click() on button press and then immediately POST the selected file.
• Add simple console.log guards everywhere so we can see if any of these steps fail.
• Confirm in DevTools > Network that the POST request actually goes out and returns 200.
• If the OpenAI Whisper or Vision endpoints are intended: supply the correct Content-Type: multipart/form-data and the Authorization: Bearer <key> header.

How to view every file quickly
Left sidebar → “Files” shows the directory tree.
If you suspect hidden files, click the three-dot menu → “Show hidden files.”
Use Ctrl-P (Cmd-P on Mac) and type a filename (e.g. voice-interface.js) to jump instantly.
The “Search” tab lets you grep the entire project for functions like startRecording( or fileUploadBtn.

Potential plot holes (things that may bite us later)
• We load Bootstrap before our own CSS; any custom widths/heights can keep getting overridden.
• No error handling on failed fetches—UI just sits in “Processing…”. Show a toast if the server returns 4xx/5xx.
• Large uploads on Replit free tier can stall; consider streaming smaller chunks or limiting file size.
• We never revoke the mic stream; add mediaStream.getTracks().forEach(t=>t.stop()) after upload completes.

Please implement those API routes and double-check the JS event bindings so the mic and file features finish their round-trip.

Thanks!
